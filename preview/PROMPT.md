/i A dark fantasy-style emblem with the bold text "BNI" in the center as the main focus. The letters are large, jagged, and carved from ancient metal or bone, slightly glowing with arcane energy. Below and around the text — pirate-themed ornaments: a grim skull with a tattered hat, crossed cutlasses, broken ship wheels, ropes, and torn sails. These elements form a rugged base and decorative sides but do not obscure or sit behind the text. The composition is moody, with subtle glowing mist and runes, rendered in a WarCraft-inspired fantasy aesthetic. Strong silhouette, high contrast, black background, and a cursed, iconic look.

/i A dark fantasy background evoking the remnants of a forgotten system or code, without showing any buildings. Abstract patterns resembling eroded symbols, fragmented sigils, tangled roots, scorched parchment, and dust-covered surfaces. Faint magical elements glow in the darkness — scattered glyphs, broken circles of light, floating sparks, and softly radiant shards embedded in the debris. Subtle traces of structure — faded grids, old markings — suggest a lost configuration or spellwork. No architecture or characters, just layered ruin and entropy. The mood is solemn, with green and violet mist. Rendered in a gritty, WarCraft-inspired gothic style — obscure, broken, glowing, and haunted by forgotten logic.
